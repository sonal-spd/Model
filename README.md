<h2>Linear Regression</h2>
   
   Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning.
   Regression is a method of modelling a target value based on independent predictors. 
   This method is mostly used for forecasting and finding out cause and effect relationship 
   between variables.Regression techniques mostly differ based on the number of independent
   variables and the type of relationship between the independent and dependent variables.
   imple linear regression is a type of regression analysis where the number of independent
   variables is one and there is a linear relationship between the independent(x) and dependent(y) variable.
   
   
   To follow on, you need python and your awesome self. Using pip we would install the following dependencies
   <ul>
     <li ><a href src =" https://numpy.org/">Numpy</a></li>
     <li ><a href src =" https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/">Pandas</a></li>
     <li ><a href src =" https://matplotlib.org/">Matplotlib</a></li>
    We are going to be using a dataset containing head size and brain weight of different people.
    This dataset is available in this <a href src = "https://github.com/sonal-spd/Model"><u>repo</u></a>.
   
   <h2>Hypothesis function for Linear Regression :</h2>
   
   ```hθ(x) = θ0 + θ1x1 + θ2x2 + θ3x3 +…..+ θnxn```
   
   
   ..............still continued so wait for some time
